### Phase 2: Anonymous Proposal Submissions

IgnitionZK ensures that DAO governance authentically represents its real-world community by requiring every member to generate zero-knowledge (ZK) credentials. This foundational step verifies each member's eligibility and forms the basis for all future governance actions.

#### Step 2.1 The Governance "Campaign"

Once all initial members have generated their credentials, the DAO can launch a governance "campaign"—a complete, self-contained governance cycle. Any member may initiate a campaign by submitting a creation request, which triggers an immediate approval vote by the DAO.

If approved, the campaign begins on the specified start date and proceeds through three phases:

1. **Proposal Submission Phase**: Members submit new ideas and initiatives for consideration.
2. **Voting Phase**: Members vote on proposals using their ZK credentials.
3. **Review Phase**: A final review period allows the proposal creators to claim ownership of accepted proposals.

IgnitionZK's campaign model is designed for flexibility:

- **On-Demand Cycles**: Campaigns can be created as needed, allowing DAOs to respond quickly to new challenges.
- **Customizable Duration**: Each campaign can have a custom start date and duration, tailored to the DAO's needs.

#### Step 2.2 Proposal Creation


When the campaign's start date arrives, the proposal submission phase opens. Each DAO defines a proposal template to ensure clarity and consistency. Members create proposals by:

1. Selecting the active campaign.
2. Filling out required details (title, description, type, funding amount).
3. Uploading the proposal document.

The proposal document is then submitted to IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), and its unique identifier (CID) is used along with the proposal details to create a unique proposal content hash.

#### Step 2.3 Verifiable Anonymous Submissions

To preserve proposer anonymity while ensuring submission integrity, IgnitionZK uses a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) generated by the `proposal_circuit.circom`. The ZKP is submitted on-chain and verified by the DAO's smart contracts:

- **Verified Membership**: The ZKP proves the submitter is a verified DAO member, enforced by the circuit and checked by the `ProposalManager` via the `ProposalVerifier`.
- **Submission Uniqueness**: It validates that the proposal is not a duplicate within the campaign. A submission nullifier, derived from the proof, is used to prevent the same proposal from being submitted more than once.
- **Content Integrity**: he proof verifies that the proposal content hash correctly represents the submitted proposal and its details.

grity**: The ZKP binds the proposal content hash to the proof, guaranteeing the proposal's authenticity.

**Onchain Flow:**

```
User (Proposer) → Generate ZK-Proof (proposal_circuit.circom) → Relayer → GovernanceManager (delegateVerifyProposal) → ProposalManager → ProposalVerifier → Store Proposal
```

- The user generates a ZK-Proof off-chain using `proposal_circuit.circom`.
- The proof and proposal details are submitted to the `GovernanceManager`, which delegates verification to the `ProposalManager` via `delegateVerifyProposal`.
- The `ProposalManager` verifies the proof and, if valid, records the proposal on-chain.

Each successful ZK submission also generates a unique claim nullifier, which the legitimate creator will later use to claim rewards if their proposal is accepted.
