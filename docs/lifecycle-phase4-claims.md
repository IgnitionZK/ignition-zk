### Phase 4: Claiming Proposal Awards

After a proposal passes the voting phase, a review period begins. During this time, the original creator must submit an "ownership claim" to de-anonymize themselves in a verifiable manner. This claim uses a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZK-Proof) generated by the `proposal_claim_circuit.circom` to prove they are the original creator without revealing any unnecessary private information.

#### Step 4.1 Submitting the Ownership Claim

The creator generates a ZK-Proof using their original, private credentials (the same ones used to create the proposal). This proof is generated off-chain using the `proposal_claim_circuit.circom` circuit and then submitted on-chain for verification.

**Mechanism**

- The ZK-Proof is constructed using the `proposal_claim_circuit.circom`, which ensures:
  - **Credential Match:** The proof confirms that the private credentials used to generate the claim match those associated with the original proposal submission.
  - **Proposal Integrity:** The proof is cryptographically bound to the specific proposal, preventing a valid proof for one proposal from being used to claim another.

**On-Chain Verification with ProposalManager.sol**

- The user submits the ZK-Proof to the ProposalManager contract.
- ProposalManager interacts with the ProposalClaimVerifier to verify the proof.
- If the proof is valid, the proposal state is updated to reflect that the claim has been made and the creator is eligible for rewards.

##### On-Chain Interaction Flow:

```
User (Proposal Creator) → Generate ZK-Proof (proposal_claim_circuit.circom) → Relayer → GovernanceManager → ProposalManager → ProposalClaimVerifier → Update Proposal State
```

With ownership verifiably established, the proposal is now ready for the final phase: **Proposal Execution**.
