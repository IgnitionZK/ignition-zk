### Phase 4: Claiming Proposal Awards

Once a proposal passes the voting phase, there’s a short review period. During this time, the original creator needs to step forward and claim ownership of the proposal. This is done using a zero-knowledge proof generated by the `proposal_claim_circuit.circom` circuit. The proof shows that the claimer is the same person who submitted the proposal.

#### Step 4.1 Making the Claim

The proposer uses their original credentials, the same ones used to submit the proposal, to generate a ZK proof off-chain. This proof is then submitted on-chain for verification.

The circuit ensures that the claim is tied to the correct proposal and that the credentials match the original submission. This prevents anyone else from claiming someone else’s proposal, and stops the same proof from being used for multiple claims.

**On-Chain Verification**

The claim proof is sent to the `ProposalManager` contract, which checks it using the `ProposalClaimVerifier`. If the proof is valid, the proposal’s state is updated to show that it’s been claimed and the creator is now eligible for any rewards or next steps.

**On-Chain flow:**

```
User (Proposal Creator) → Generate ZK-Proof (proposal_claim_circuit.circom) → Relayer → GovernanceManager → ProposalManager → ProposalClaimVerifier → Emits event →  Update Proposal State (off-chain)
```
Once the claim is verified, the proposal is ready for execution and fund release.
