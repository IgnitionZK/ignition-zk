  "proposalType": "New Product/Service Launch - Strategic Investment",
  "status": "Draft",
  "summary": "This proposal seeks funding to launch [New Product/E-Service Name], leveraging a novel Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZK-Proof) enabled DAO framework for its development and operational governance. By ensuring verifiable, yet privacy-preserving, expert-driven decision-making, this model aims to accelerate product development cycles, enhance accountability within the product team, and improve market responsiveness.",
  "abstract": "We propose the development and market launch of [New Product/E-Service Name], supported by a 'Limited-Member, Closed-Group Product DAO.' This framework utilizes Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to issue Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) that cryptographically verify a member's legitimate role or expertise within the product development and management team (e.g., lead developer, product manager, legal counsel) without exposing their individual identity to external stakeholders. This approach addresses common pitfalls in traditional product development—such as siloed decision-making, diffused accountability, and slow iteration—by ensuring critical product decisions are made efficiently by highly engaged, verifiable, and accountable experts.",
  "motivation": "In today's competitive market, rapid innovation, agile development, and clear accountability are critical for successful product launches. Traditional top-down or heavily centralized product development processes can suffer from:\n1. **Slow Decision-Making:** Bureaucratic approvals and lack of direct stakeholder empowerment can delay critical product pivots.\n2. **Diffused Accountability:** When many individuals are involved without clear on-chain roles, assigning responsibility for product missteps or missed deadlines becomes challenging.\n3. **Lack of Transparency (Internal):** Key decisions may lack auditable trails, hindering post-mortem analysis and continuous improvement.\n4. **Expertise Verification:** Ensuring that only truly qualified individuals are making core product decisions can be difficult to verify externally. This proposal directly addresses these challenges by introducing a targeted, secure, and highly accountable governance model for our product development lifecycle.",
  "problemStatement": "Launching a new product or e-service in a rapidly evolving market demands unprecedented agility and precision. Current internal governance structures, while robust for established operations, often introduce friction into the innovation pipeline. This friction manifests as delayed feature releases, misaligned product strategies due to broad, unverified input, and a lack of clear ownership over product success or failure. We need a mechanism that empowers core product teams to make swift, informed, and accountable decisions while maintaining corporate oversight and data privacy.",
  "solutionProposed": {
    "description": "Our solution is to launch **[New Product/E-Service Name]** under the governance of a **Limited-Member, Closed-Group Product DAO**. This model ensures that only genuinely qualified and relevant personnel (the core product team) participate in key decisions, fostering high engagement and clear accountability throughout the product lifecycle. Key components include:\n- **ZK-Powered NFT-Gated Membership:** Membership in the Product DAO is granted via NFTs. The legitimacy of the NFT (i.e., that the holder possesses a verified internal role, certification, or expertise relevant to [New Product/E-Service Name]) is proven via ZKPs. This means the DAO's smart contract can cryptographically verify a team member's eligibility *without* revealing their specific identity or sensitive HR data to external parties.\n- **Privacy-Preserving Identity:** While the *fact* of a team member's verified product role is on-chain, their individual identity remains pseudonymous or entirely private to external observers. Within the closed product team, existing professional relationships and the transparency of on-chain participation (e.g., voting on feature prioritization) maintain social accountability.\n- **Enhanced Accountability & Agile Development:** The limited size of this Product DAO ensures each team member's vote carries significant weight, encouraging active participation in critical decisions (e.g., feature prioritization, budget allocation for development sprints, marketing strategy adjustments). This, combined with verifiable roles and collective performance-based incentives, drives higher accountability and streamlines decision-making processes for rapid product iteration and market responsiveness.",
    "keyFeatures": [
      "**ZK-Powered Verifiable Product Roles:** On-chain proof of expertise/roles within the product team without exposing PII.",
      "**Pseudonymous Product Governance:** Secure participation while protecting sensitive team member data and internal strategy details.",
      "**Optimized for Product Teams:** Designed for small, high-impact groups driving product development and launch.",
      "**Streamlined Product Decision Cycles:** Higher participation and clear accountability lead to faster feature approvals and market pivots.",
      "**Collective Performance Incentives:** Mechanisms for product team staking tied to launch milestones and post-launch KPIs (e.g., user adoption, revenue targets)."
    ],
    "zkTechnologyDetails": {
      "proofSystem": "We will utilize industry-standard ZK-SNARKs (e.g., Groth16 or Plonk) to ensure cryptographic robustness and efficient on-chain verification for credentialing and private voting.",
      "circuitDesignOverview": "Circuits will be designed to prove possession of a valid internal credential (e.g., a hash of an employee ID, a signed attestation from a department head, or proof of specific project experience) without revealing the actual ID or the employee's name. This allows the Product DAO contract to verify eligibility securely and privately. Additional circuits may enable private voting on sensitive product strategy decisions.",
      "privacyGuarantees": "Individual product team members' identities and their specific credential data remain off-chain and private. Only the cryptographic proof of their eligibility for a specific role within the Product DAO is verified on-chain. This minimizes data exposure and enhances compliance with privacy regulations, crucial for internal corporate data.",
      "trustedSetupRequired": "If a trusted setup is required for the chosen ZK-SNARK, we will leverage existing, audited multi-party computation (MPC) ceremonies or explore transparent ZK-STARK alternatives to mitigate this risk, ensuring the highest level of security for our product governance.",
      "scalabilityImplications": "ZKPs enable efficient on-chain verification of complex off-chain data (credentials/roles), reducing gas costs and improving the scalability of membership verification for dynamic product teams compared to traditional on-chain identity solutions.",

    "collectiveStakingProposed": {
      "enabled": true,
      "details": "We propose a collective staking mechanism where the Product DAO (as a collective entity) stakes a portion of the product's development budget or a dedicated internal allocation. This staked capital would be eligible for significant performance bonuses if the product consistently meets predefined launch KPIs (e.g., user acquisition targets, initial revenue goals, successful feature adoption). Conversely, it could face a predefined reduction for significant failures in meeting governance responsibilities (e.g., repeated failure to reach quorum on critical product decisions, or verifiable negative impacts from DAO-approved actions leading to product failure). This mechanism directly aligns the Product DAO's on-chain performance with tangible product launch and market success outcomes."
